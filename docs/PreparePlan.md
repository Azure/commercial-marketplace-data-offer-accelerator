# Preparing to create a Plan in Partner Center portal

 To prepare for creating your Offer and Plans in the Partner Center portal, there are some artifacts you must prepare. This requires that you locally clone or download the contents of the repository.

 The steps you must perform include the following.

 1. Acquire and use a special GUID used to enable metrics tracking of your customer's solutions from within the Partner Center portal.
 1. Create a ZIP file that will be uploaded with each plan you create in the Partner Center portal. This ZIP file contains artifacts needed to create the Azure resources in the consumer's tenant.
